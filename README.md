# Miako1202-CSC4850-MachineLearning-AssignmentThree

This is a repository for Assignment3 for the course "Machine Learning and Data Mining" at CSC4850. 

## Problem Statement

The goal of this assignment is to practice implementing and SVMs for classification tasks, using different folds with its classification report AND plot its learning curve and also presented a table with the following columns from their metrics and mode. The assignment involves creating SVM models with different kernel functions (linear, polynomial, and radial basis function) and comparing their performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Data

The data used in this project was obtained from the Kaggle dataset "Chess Game Dataset" by user DatASnake (https://www.kaggle.com/datasnaek/chess). The dataset consists of more than 20,000 chess games played between players with Elo rating of over 2200. The data is provided in a single CSV file, which includes information such as the date of the game, the player names, Elo ratings, and the moves made during the game.
